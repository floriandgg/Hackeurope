(\"Apple\") concerning the materially false and defamatory article published by the New York Post on or about [Date of Publication], titled \"Apple News ‘inflames political polarization’ as it excludes conservative outlets from ‘top stories’: bombshell study\" (the \"Article\").\n\nThe Article contains numerous false and misleading statements regarding the operation and principles of the Apple News service. Specifically, the assertion that Apple systematically and intentionally excludes certain outlets based on political viewpoint is factually incorrect and unsubstantiated. The Article relies on a flawed interpretation of our curation process, which is designed to ensure viewpoint diversity and impartiality through a combination of algorithmic and human review.\n\nThese false statements have caused and continue to cause significant and irreparable harm to Apple's reputation and brand, which is built on user trust. The Article's claims constitute defamation and trade libel.\n\nAccordingly, we demand that you immediately and permanently retract the Article from all your platforms and issue a prominent public correction that is mutually agreeable. Failure to comply within five (5) business days of receipt of this notice will compel Apple to pursue all available legal remedies to protect its rights and reputation, including but not limited to seeking damages and injunctive relief.\n\nThis letter is sent without prejudice to any of Apple's rights and remedies, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name]\nGeneral Counsel\nApple Inc.",
    "decision_summary": "The situation was assessed as CRITICAL due to high severity (4/5), regulatory involvement (FTC), and a significant 6.0% churn risk. Historical data shows that denialist strategies fail, while transparent clarification succeeds. Therefore, the 'Diplomate' strategy was recommended to directly mitigate churn risk and de-escalate regulatory pressure. This approach maximizes ROI by protecting brand trust in a cost-effective manner."
