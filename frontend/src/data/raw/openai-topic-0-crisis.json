The reported internal discussions highlight a complex and challenging dilemma that we take with the utmost seriousness: balancing user privacy with the responsibility to prevent harm. We recognize the gravity of this situation and are taking immediate action.\n\nOpenAI is commissioning a comprehensive, independent review of our policies and procedures for identifying and escalating potential threats of real-world harm. We are committed to working with outside experts, law enforcement, and policymakers to ensure our protocols are as effective as possible. We will be transparent about the findings of this review and the changes we implement as a result.\n\nWe are dedicated to building safe and beneficial AI, and that includes constantly learning and improving our safety systems.

This implication is materially misleading and omits critical legal context regarding data privacy laws and the complex, often ambiguous, nature of user-generated content.\n\nWe demand that you publish a prominent clarification within 48 hours, stating that no legal or regulatory body has established a definitive legal obligation for AI companies to proactively monitor and report non-imminent threats of this nature, and that such actions carry significant privacy implications.\n\nFailure to issue this clarification will be considered a willful disregard for the full context of the situation, causing material harm to our reputation. We reserve all rights to pursue legal action to remedy the damages incurred. Please govern yourselves accordingly.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[General Counsel Name]\nOpenAI, Inc.",
    "decision_summary": "The incident was classified as CRITICAL due to its link to a mass shooting, high severity (4/5), and significant churn risk (6.0%).

This strategy focuses on transparency and accountability to rebuild trust, directly addressing the churn risk and offering the best path to mitigating long-term reputational and financial harm."
