Our client's internal deliberations, as reported in other media, reflect a complex legal and ethical analysis regarding user privacy and the appropriate threshold for proactive law enforcement referral, not an act of concealment. No formal request for this information was denied, and no attempt was made to hide or destroy data.\n\nWe demand the immediate and prominent retraction of these false statements and the publication of a correction that accurately reflects the situation. Failure to comply within 48 hours will compel our client, OpenAI, to pursue all available legal remedies to protect its reputation, including but not limited to legal action for defamation.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Legal Counsel for OpenAI]",
    "decision_summary": "The situation was classified as CRITICAL due to the high severity (4/5) of the issue and the significant churn risk (6.0%).

This proactive approach offers the best return on investment by prioritizing long-term brand health over a defensive, high-risk legal posture."
