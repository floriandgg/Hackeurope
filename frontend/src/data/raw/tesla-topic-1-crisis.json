    "press_release": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nTesla Updates Marketing Language in California in Collaboration with DMV to Enhance Consumer Clarity\n\nPALO ALTO, CA – Tesla announced today that it is updating the marketing terms for its advanced driver-assistance features in California. This proactive step is the result of collaborative discussions with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and is aimed at ensuring the clearest possible communication for customers.\n\nWhile the names 'Autopilot' and 'Full Self-Driving' are being adjusted in some marketing materials within the state, the capabilities of these industry-leading systems remain unchanged. All Tesla vehicles will continue to receive over-the-air software updates that improve functionality and introduce new features. Tesla's systems are designed to make driving safer and less stressful, and the company remains committed to the continuous development of autonomous technology.\n\n'We are working with the DMV to address their feedback and are confident that these minor adjustments to our marketing language will eliminate any potential for confusion,' said a Tesla spokesperson. 'Our priority is and always has been the safety of our customers and the public. We are proud of our technology's safety record and will continue to innovate while ensuring our communications are transparent and clear.'\n\nThis update reflects Tesla's commitment to working cooperatively with regulators as this innovative technology continues to evolve.",

In collaboration with the California DMV, we are making some adjustments to the language we use to describe our 'Autopilot' and 'Full Self-Driving' features in the state.\n\nThis is a proactive step to ensure we maintain the clearest possible communication with our customers about our technology's capabilities. It's important to note that this is a change in marketing terminology only; the functionality of our advanced driver-assistance systems is not changing. Our vehicles remain as capable as ever, and we will continue to push the boundaries of innovation with over-the-air updates.\n\nWe are framing this publicly as a cooperative effort with regulators, which it is. Please ensure any customer conversations reflect this collaborative and transparent approach. Your confidence in our products is crucial, and this move helps reinforce our commitment to both innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThank you for your continued hard work and dedication to the Tesla mission.",

    "decision_summary": "The alert level was set to MEDIUM due to a high 6.0% churn risk, which poses a greater threat than the low immediate VaR. The recommended 'Diplomate' strategy directly mitigates this churn risk by communicating transparently about the marketing changes. This approach, supported by historical precedents like Ford's successful handling of a similar issue, offers the best ROI by protecting brand trust and customer relationships while ensuring regulatory compliance."
